Bring Lock is a plugin that locks the admin panel through API requests

== Description ==


### Bring Lock


[Bring Lock](https://br.wordpress.org/plugins/bring-lock) was developed with the sole and exclusive purpose of blocking the Wordpress Admin Panel so that no other user can log in, not even the site administrator. Blocking occurs when a request is made to the Plugin's API along with the token configured on the panel.

**Features**
